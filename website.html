        <div class="grid-item">üè´ Educational Activities
            School Lunch Program: In 2014, GS Gahurire introduced a school lunch program, where students are released and continue studying until 10:00. This program has shown positive changes in students'
             learning, as they began to attend classes
             more effectively without feeling tired or hungry as they had previously. Parents are also happy with this program,
             as they are involved in contributing money or food that will help prepare meals for students.</div>
        <div class="grid-item">üìù How to register
            Those who wish to study at GS Gahurire are required to:
            
            Register on the school website: They can visit the school website or go to the school in person and register.
            
            Prepare the required documents: As usual, they will be required to provide documents that prove their identity, such as an identity card or birth certificate.
            
            üí∞ Fees and subsidies
            Fee: Information on fees has not yet been published on the school website. Those interested in detailed information on fees
             are advised to contact the school or the Ngoma district administration.
